#### Local setup using Docker (Recommended on Windows)

You need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running in your local machine:

- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Then, clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
```

Finally, run the following command that will pull a pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Note that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 300MB or so.

Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). After you are done, you can use the same command (`docker-compose up`) to render the webpage with all you changes. Also, make sure to commit your final changes.

<details><summary>(click to expand) <strong>Build your own docker image (more advanced):</strong></summary>

> Note: this approach is only necessary if you would like to build an older or very custom version of al-folio.

First, download the necessary modules and install them into a docker image called `al-folio:Dockerfile` (this command will build an image which is used to run your website afterwards. Note that you only need to do this step once. After you have the image, you no longer need to do this anymore):


```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-local.yml build
```

Run the website!

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-local.yml up
```

> To change port number, you can edit `docker-compose.yml` file.

> If you want to update jekyll, install new ruby packages, etc., all you have to do is build the image again! It will download ruby and jekyll and install all ruby packages again from scratch.

</details>

### Other features

#### GitHub repositories and user stats
**al-folio** uses [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) to display GitHub repositories and user stats on the the `/repositories/` page.

Edit the `_data/repositories.yml` and change the `github_users` and `github_repos` lists to include your own GitHub profile and repositories to the the `/repositories/` page.

You may also use the following codes for displaying this in any other pages.
```
<!-- code for GitHub users -->
{% if site.data.repositories.github_users %}
<div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %}
    {% include repository/repo_user.html username=user %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}

<!-- code for GitHub repositories -->
{% if site.data.repositories.github_repos %}
<div class="repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center">
  {% for repo in site.data.repositories.github_repos %}
    {% include repository/repo.html repository=repo %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>
{% endif %}
```

#### Theming
A variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from.
The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the
`--global-theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file.
Other color variables are listed there as well.
The stock theme color options available can be found at `_sass/variables.scss`.
You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of
use across the template.

#### Social media previews
**al-folio** supports preview images on social media.
To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your `_config.yml`.
Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.

You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews.
This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable.
If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your `_config.yml`.
In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.
